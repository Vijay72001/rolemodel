Most Indians today, when questioned, would not recognize the name of Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddi (1886-1968) – a reality that needs to be remedied as she is an important figure in Indian history, being the first Indian female legislator and the founder behind one of the biggest cancer institutes in India. Despite facing numerous challenges and hindrances being born as a woman in pre-independence India, in an era where there were little to none resources and opportunities for women, she went on to become a trailblazer in more than one field and pave the way for coming generations of women.<br><br>

<center><b>History</b></center><br>

<p><li>During the times of mid-19th century, the foundation of this event occurred.</li>
<p><li>The main goal of the movement was in the interests of the women.</li>
<p><li>This event wanted to provide women with a window for education and active community service which will also influence their belonging towards their own community.</li>
<p><li>Before the stones of this movement were laid down, most of the women of the mid-1800’s were in support of the men’s group.</li>
<p><li>Indeed everything comes with an exception and so this community. Not all women were an assistant to the church sponsored-aid societies.</li>
<p><li>They did an indeed excellent duty under the groups they were assigned with them but the only thing that was unacceptable was such organizations were under the sole control of men.</li><br><br>

She was nominated by Sakthi Hari Haran to the Madras Legislature as a member of the legislative council in 1926 and became the first woman to be a member of any legislature in India. When she was elected as the deputy chairperson of the legislative council, she became the first woman in the world to become the vice president of a legislature. She was the prime mover behind the legislation that abolished the Devadasi system and played a keen role in raising the minimum marriage age for women in India. In 1930, she resigned from the Madras Legislature as a protest following the imprisonment of Mahatma Gandhi. She argued for the removal of the Devadasi system that was widely prevalent in Tamil Nadu at that time against stiff resistance from the Congress lobby led by Dheerar Sathyamoorthy, also from Pudhukkottai. She was the founder-president of the Women's Indian Association (WIA) and became the first alderwoman of the Madras Corporation.
